# SM-15 Algorithm Documentation

The SM-15 spaced repetition algorithm is the core of this learning application. This section provides comprehensive documentation for understanding and implementing the algorithm.

## ðŸ“‹ Algorithm Overview

SM-15 is an advanced spaced repetition algorithm that optimizes learning by:
- **Adaptive Scheduling**: Cards appear at optimal intervals for maximum retention
- **Personalized Difficulty**: A-Factors adjust based on individual performance  
- **Dynamic Optimization**: OF Matrix learns from user patterns over time
- **Memory Science**: Based on forgetting curve and memory stability research

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts (Quick Reference)

### A-Factor System
- **Range**: 1.1 (easy) to 2.5 (hard)
- **Purpose**: Represents intrinsic item difficulty
- **Updates**: Weighted average of old and new difficulty estimates

### OF Matrix (Optimal Factors Matrix)
- **Structure**: 2D matrix `OF[repetition_number, difficulty_category]`  
- **Function**: Provides optimal interval multipliers
- **Learning**: Refines based on actual user performance

### Interval Calculation
```
I(1) = OF[1, L+1]           // First interval based on lapses
I(n) = I(n-1) Ã— OF[n, AF]   // Subsequent intervals
```

### Memory Model
- **Stability (S)**: How long memory trace persists
- **Retrievability (R)**: Current recall probability
- **Forgetting Function**: `R = exp(-t/S)`

## ðŸŽ¯ Grade Scale (5-Point System)

| Grade | Meaning | Effect | Example Response Time |
|-------|---------|--------|---------------------|
| 5 | Perfect | Significant interval increase | Immediate recall |
| 4 | Easy | Moderate interval increase | < 2 seconds |
| 3 | Good | Slight interval increase | 2-5 seconds |
| 2 | Hard | Interval decrease | 5+ seconds, hesitation |
| 1 | Failed | Reset to short interval | Could not recall |
